# Frontend Mentor - Base Apparel coming soon page solution

This is my solution to the [Base Apparel coming soon page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**NOTE: I did not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is far from being pixel perfect.**
